## Step 4
1. Output files to step 4 (word count) are in the folder `output-4`

## Step 5
1. Python code for step 5 is named `bigrams.py`. 
2. To run the code, type ```spark-submit path/to/wordcount.py path/to/wiki.txt```. Note that my program only accepts two parameter (path to the code and path to the text file), and both outputs (counts and distribution) are automatically saved to the same directory where my code is.
3. Output files to step 5 (count of all bigram words) are in the folder `counts-5`
4. Output files to step 5 (conditional bigram frequency distribution) are in the folder `freq-5`
